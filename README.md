# nucleotide

Roguelike autobattler in which player is drafting and rearranging the genetic code of their character and battling it against foes.

Mechanics:
- There are genes which have some sort of effect, e.g.
    - Utility: Skip the next gene, reverse the order of consumption, etc.
    - Offense: Attack, Poison
    - Defense: Armor, Evasion
    - Status
    ...
- Certain genes when used together on the same turn will combine to do extra powerful things (these are the "Side Effects")
- At the beginning of the game, the gene pool is mapped to greek letters, so you don't know which genes are mapped to which letters
- Your hero starts with several genes always and a few random random ones
- In each battle, you and the foe take turns reading off N genes and doing their action until one of you wins
- After each battle, you can add new genes, remove old genes, or reorder genes in some way
